# ToDo using Solidity, Hardhat and React

This app is provides a simple implementation of ToDo using Solidity, Hardhat and React.
##### Technology/Tools
- HardHat (for local Node and deployment) 
- Solidity (for contracts)
- React and NodeJs (for Frontend)
- Metamask (for transactions)
- VSCode (Persoanl preference)

#### Installation

This app recommends [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v16+ to run.

Go to root in directory. Run npm following commands for dependencies installation and run: 

```sh
npm i
npm start
```
Open new terminal and run following commands:
```sh
npx hardhat compile (This will compile Solidity contracts)
npx hardhat node (This will run Node locally)
```
Open new terminal and run following command to deploy contract:
```sh
 npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost (If things will go well, you will contract address. Copy this address and replace in src/context/SmartContract/index.js line 20)
```
Now install Metamask and connect with http://localhost:8545
